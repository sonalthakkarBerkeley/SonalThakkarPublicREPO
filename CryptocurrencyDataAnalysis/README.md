#### Background: 
---
Bitcoin is a digital cryptocurrency and payment system that is entirely decentralized, meaning it is based on peer- to-peer transactions with no bureaucratic oversight. Transactions and liquidity within the network are instead based on cryptography. The system first emerged formally in 2009 and is currently a thriving open-source community and payment network. Based on the uniqueness of Bitcoinâ€™s payment protocol and its growing adoption, the Bitcoin ecosystem is gaining lots of attention from businesses, consumers, and investors alike. Namely, for the ecosystem to thrive, we need to replicate financial services and products that currently exist in our traditional, fiat currency world and make them available and custom-tailored to Bitcoin, as well as other emerging cryptocurrencies.
